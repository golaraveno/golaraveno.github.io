Hi! I've prepared some personal experiences regarding updating an old fashioned asp .net mvc to brand new asp .net core


# How?

Of course it's going to be controversial and it's not black and white, but I've been trying to gather appropriate information involving with my knowledge during the past couple of years to show you guys how you are able to get rid of your old app and move to **.net core** world!

## Agenda!

I'm gonna be talking about following kind of stuff:

- Why ASP .NET core?
	> What has been changed? what should I care? Is it that much important to put much effort and time trying to update to asp .net core?

- Differences between Old asp .net mvc and core
	> This is super crucial understanding  the differences otherwise this period would be tough!
	
- OWIN
	> What exactly OWIN is and how we can take advantage of that.

- Demo
	> Of course as well as any other presentation we have a demo here.
